# Welcome to North Saga - Where History Meets Technology

Welcome to North Saga, where we explore the fascinating connections between ancient civilizations and modern technology. Our mission is to digitally reconstruct the great trade networks of the North Sea Empire and the Hanseatic League, showing how these medieval innovations laid the groundwork for today's global commerce.

## Our Vision

The North Sea Empire and the Hanseatic League weren't just historical phenomena—they were the world's first global networks, connecting distant lands through trade, technology, and cultural exchange. Today, we're using AI, blockchain, and data visualization to bring these ancient networks back to life.

## What We're Building

- **Interactive Timeline Maps**: Digital reconstructions of trade routes
- **AI-Powered Research**: Using Claude to analyze historical patterns  
- **Blockchain Integration**: Exploring how crypto mirrors medieval trade
- **Content Ecosystem**: Blog posts, YouTube shorts, and social media

## The Tech Stack

Our project leverages modern web technologies:
- Next.js for the frontend
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- AI assistance for content creation
- Vercel for deployment

This very website is built using these tools, and we'll be documenting our entire journey—from conception to deployment.

## Coming Next

Stay tuned for deep dives into:
- The digital DNA of Viking trade routes
- How the Hanseatic League pioneered global commerce
- Modern parallels in cryptocurrency and digital trade
- Building this website with AI assistance
