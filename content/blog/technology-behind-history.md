# The Technology Behind History

In our quest to digitally reconstruct the medieval trade networks, we're leveraging cutting-edge web technologies to bring ancient history to life. This isn't just about displaying information—it's about creating an interactive experience that bridges the gap between past and present.

## The Digital Manuscript

Our website itself is a testament to the fusion of old and new. Built with Next.js and styled with Tailwind CSS, we've created a digital manuscript that honors the aesthetic traditions of medieval texts while embracing modern web standards.

### The Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering and optimal performance
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive, utility-first styling
- **Markdown**: For content management, mirroring the simplicity of medieval manuscripts
- **AI Integration**: Using Claude to assist with research and content creation

## AI-Powered Historical Research

One of our most exciting innovations is using artificial intelligence to analyze historical patterns. Claude helps us:

- Cross-reference historical documents
- Identify patterns in trade routes
- Generate hypotheses about medieval commerce
- Translate and interpret ancient texts

## From Parchment to Pixels

The transition from physical manuscripts to digital content isn't just about format—it's about accessibility. Where once knowledge was locked away in monastery libraries, now anyone with an internet connection can explore the rich history of the North Sea Empire.

## The Future of Historical Technology

As we continue to develop this platform, we're exploring:

- Interactive maps showing trade routes
- Blockchain integration for digital artifacts
- Virtual reality experiences of medieval ports
- Machine learning for pattern recognition in historical data

The technology behind history isn't just about preserving the past—it's about making it accessible, interactive, and relevant to our digital age.
